Steps to Set Up and Configure Microsoft Entra External ID

1. Create a Microsoft Entra Tenant
   - If you don't already have a Microsoft Entra tenant, create one by signing up for Microsoft Entra ID.

2. Register Your Application
   - Go to the Microsoft Entra admin center.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
   - Enter a name for your application and configure the redirect URI (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/callback`).

3. Configure External Identities
   - Navigate to Identity > External Identities > All identity providers.
   - Click Add identity provider and select the type of identity provider you want to add (e.g., Google, Facebook, or another SAML/WS-Fed provider).
   - Follow the prompts to configure the identity provider. For example, if adding Google, you’ll need to enter the client ID and client secret obtained from the Google Developer Console.

4. Set Up User Flows
   - Go to Identity > External Identities > User flows.
   - Click New user flow and select the type of user flow you need (e.g., sign-up and sign-in).
   - Configure the user flow by selecting the identity providers you added earlier and customizing the attributes and claims.

5. Configure SSO for Your Application
   - In the App registrations section, select your application.
   - Go to Authentication and add a platform configuration (e.g., Web).
   - Set the redirect URIs and configure implicit grant settings if needed.

6. Implement SSO in Your Application
   - Use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to integrate SSO into your application.
   - Here’s an example using Node.js:

   ```javascript

   const msal = require('@azure/msal-node');

   const config = {
     auth: {
       clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
       authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_ID',
       clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
     }
   };

   const cca = new msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(config);

   const authCodeUrlParameters = {
     scopes: ["user.read"],
     redirectUri: "https://yourapp.com/callback"
   };

   // Get URL to sign user in and consent to scopes needed for application
   cca.getAuthCodeUrl(authCodeUrlParameters).then((response) => {
     console.log(response);
   }).catch((error) => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)));

   ```

7. Test the Integration
   - Ensure that users can log in using the external identities you configured.
   - Test different scenarios to verify that the SSO flow works as expected.

Example Configuration

#Microsoft Entra Admin Center

1. Register Your Application:
   - Go to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
   - Enter the application name and configure the redirect URI.

2. Add Identity Providers:
   - Navigate to Identity > External Identities > All identity providers.
   - Add the desired identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

3. Configure User Flows:
   - Go to Identity > External Identities > User flows.
   - Create and configure user flows for sign-up and sign-in.

4. Set Up SSO:
   - In App registrations, select your application.
   - Go to Authentication and configure the platform settings.

Best Practices

1. Use Conditional Access Policies
   - Implement conditional access policies to enhance security by requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) or restricting access based on location.

2. Monitor and Audit
   - Regularly monitor sign-in activity and audit logs to detect any unusual behavior.

3. Keep Credentials Secure
   - Ensure that client secrets and other sensitive information are stored securely.

By following these steps, you can set up and configure Microsoft Entra External ID to provide SSO and login access to external identities for your custom-developed applications.
